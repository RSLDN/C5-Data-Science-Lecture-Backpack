Password Strength Evaluator

This script is designed to evaluate the strength of a given password based on the principles of
combinations and probabilities.
It is particularly relevant for students in both software engineering and data science fields.

Scenario:
- The script takes a password as input.
- It then considers various character sets: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special
characters.
- For each length up to the length of the input password, the script calculates the total number of
possible combinations using these character sets.
- It evaluates the probability of guessing the password correctly on the first try, based on these
combinations.
- Finally, the script outputs an evaluation of the password strength (weak, moderate, or strong)
based on the calculated probability.

Purpose:
- For software engineering students, this script demonstrates a practical application of combinations
and probability in a software application.
- For data science students, it offers a clear example of applying statistical analysis and
probabilistic calculations in real-world scenarios.

Usage:
- Run the script and enter a password when prompted.
- The script will then evaluate and display the strength of the provided password.
